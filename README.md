The goal of polyester2 is to create a simulated OMOP CDM database for
data modeling.

## Installation

You can install polyester2 with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("meerapatelmd/polyester2")
```

## Example

Artificial data is first generated using Synthea by:

``` r
library(polyester2)
run_synthea(populationSize = 1000,
            state = "California",
            city = "Los Angeles")
```

The output data is located in a subdirectory `synthea_output` folder in
the working directory named by timestamp. This way, multiple rounds of
Synthea can be executed and saved without being overwritten.

The native Synthea output can be ETLâ€™d into the OMOP CDM:

``` r
library(polyester2)
etl_to_omop(user = "root",
            password = "candycane",
            server = "localhost/taffeta",
            port = 5432,
            omop_cdm_schema = "omop",
            synthea_schema = "synthea",
            path_to_synthea_csvs = "synthea_output/2020-11-14 11:00:00:00/csv",
            path_to_omop_vocab_csvs = "~/athena_vocabulary")
```

The function will fail to execute if a connection cannot be made using
the credentials provided or if the schemas do not exist.
